		<h3>Parkify</h3>

		<p>Designed and developed an innovative and intuitive application aimed at addressing the ongoing challenge of urban parking in crowded metropolitan areas. The application streamlines the process of finding available parking spots by using real-time data to guide users to the nearest open spaces, significantly reducing the time spent searching for parking and minimizing congestion. This solution not only provides a user-friendly interface but also incorporates sophisticated technical features to ensure smooth operation.

            To build the application, I utilized a Python-based Streamlit interface, known for its simplicity and efficiency in creating web applications with minimal code. The front-end was designed to be clean and easy to navigate, ensuring a seamless experience for users of all technical backgrounds. In addition, I integrated the application with a Google Sheets API, allowing the application to pull and update data on available parking spots dynamically. This integration enabled the system to display real-time availability, ensuring that users are always provided with up-to-date information.
            
            The project provided me with an invaluable opportunity to refine my skills in software development, particularly in the areas of API integration, real-time data handling, and building interactive web interfaces. The applicationâ€™s effectiveness in reducing parking time and its potential to ease traffic congestion in busy urban environments further enhanced my technical expertise, making this project a significant achievement in my development journey.
