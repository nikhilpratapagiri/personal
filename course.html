		<h3>URateMyCourse</h3>

		<p>A comprehensive full-stack Django application was developed to provide UMass Amherst Computer Science students with a platform to write and share reviews about specific courses. The application allows users to rate courses on a scale from 1 to 5 stars and add descriptive text alongside their ratings. This feature provides valuable insights for prospective students, helping them make informed decisions about which courses to take based on the experiences of their peers.

            The back-end of the application was built using Django, a high-level Python web framework, ensuring robust and scalable functionality. Data is stored and managed through a SQLite database, offering a lightweight and efficient solution for handling course reviews and ratings. The front-end of the application was designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. The use of JavaScript enhances interactivity, enabling smooth dynamic updates, such as real-time star rating adjustments.
            
            This project not only involved creating a functional and user-centric application but also required implementing a clean architecture, ensuring seamless integration between the front-end and back-end. The application serves as a valuable tool for UMass Amherst CS students, facilitating transparency and enabling the sharing of course feedback in an accessible and organized manner.
